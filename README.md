### Download the Datasets!

There are three datasets used in the paper: Yelp 2013, AAPR, and PolMed.

To download Yelp 2013, refer to the following <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PxAkmPLFMnfom46FMMXkHeqIxDbA16oy">link</a> from the original authors.

Although they were constructed by different authors (please refer to these links for <a href="https://github.com/lancopku/AAPR">AAPR</a> and <a href="https://www.figure-eight.com/">PolMed</a>, we use specific data splits for the AAPR and PolMed datasets.
Download our splits <a href="https://github.com/zizi1532/BasisCustomize/releases/download/1.0/datasets.zip">here</a>.
