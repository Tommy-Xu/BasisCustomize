more debt w / zero spending reforms ? unacceptable . i strongly believe we must act to avoid defaulting on our debt payments and reopen the government . but i cannot support a plan that increases our nation ‰ űşs debt by half a trillion dollars while offering no spending reforms . washington ‰ űşs addiction to spending is what led to this mess , and piling on more debt while ignoring the spending problem is exactly the wrong approach . a better way forward would be honest , simple legislation that ( 1 ) takes care of our debt needs with corresponding spending reforms , ( 2 ) provides temporary government funding , and ( 3 ) allows us time to work toward a real budget . i know a majority of republicans and democrats would ultimately support such a plan . the problem is the ‰ ű ÷ shutdown strategy ‰ űş damaged the house ‰ űşs bargaining power in these negotiations . i hope conservatives can now regroup and begin work on achievable priorities that are important to regular americans : striving to protect americans from obamacare ‰ űşs harmful mandates and taxes , setting sustainable spending levels that continue to drive down the deficit , and pushing a pro-growth agenda that will help create jobs for people in alabama and throughout the country . <http>		constituency		neutral		R000591		facebook		support

today's jobs report is no cause for celebration . the reason behind the drop in the unemployment rate is because americans are leaving the workforce . in fact , the labor force participation rate is at its lowest level in 35 years ! we need to focus on creating an environment where innovation , small business , and entrepreneurship can thrive . that means removing roadblocks to job creation like obamacare and dodd-frank and making america more energy independent . at the current rate unemployment would actually be increasing if we take into account the number of people " left behind " by the government's calculation . read more from the associated press : the drop in the unemployment rate in august to a 4ĺ_ - year low was hardly cause for celebration . the rate fell because more people stopped looking for work . more than 300,000 people stopped working or looking for a job . their exodus shrank the so-called labor force participation rate ‰ űó the percentage of adult americans with a job or seeking one ‰ űó to 63.2 percent . it's the lowest participation rate since august 1978 . once people without a job stop looking for one , the government no longer counts them as unemployed . that's why the unemployment rate dropped to 7.3 percent in august from 7.4 percent in july even though 115,000 fewer people said they had jobs . if those who left the labor force last month had still been looking for work , the unemployment rate would have risen to 7.5 percent in august . <http>		national		neutral		H001058		facebook		policy

isis flourished after this administration rushed away our assistance to iraq , lost international credibility by not backing up its ‰ ű ÷ red line ‰ űş in syria , and deferred action to allies who had depended on us to lead . now that our enemies have gained strength after we showed weakness , the president has concluded that we must again put men and women of our armed forces in harm ‰ űşs way . we face a real threat , and our nation needs to show leadership . if president obama is finally ready to drop the wobbly rhetoric and lead a coalition , i am prepared to offer him the support he needs to put down the extremists who threaten us and have committed horrendous crimes against humanity . several of my colleagues and i have put our support behind h . j . resolution 123 , which would require the president to present a strategic plan to congress , replaces the old 2002 authorization for use of military force against iraq , and provides the president with a new , short-term authorization for the use of force to defeat isis . rhetoric doesn ‰ űşt win wars . if president obama is now prepared to seek authorization for action against isis , i ‰ űşm prepared to give it to him .		national		partisan		I000056		facebook		support
president obama will negotiate with the russians and the iranians , but he will not come to capitol hill and talk with the duly elected representatives of the american people . he wants to see the government shut down , but that is not what we want or what hardworking americans want . obamacare is not ready to be rolled out on october 1st and it is going to drive our economy into the fiscal ditch . the house will vote on a delay of the individual mandate for one year . we believe that americans should be afforded the same consideration that the president has promised to big business . we also want fairness for all and have included a measure that will strip out the federal contribution for members , staff , the president ‰ űşs cabinet and political appointees . the house has been the only one fighting to avert a government shutdown . we have worked through the weekend , while the senate stayed in recess . the president has refused to speak with the people ‰ űşs elected representatives . it is time for the senate and the president to become engaged and fight for commonsense solutions for the american people . a government shutdown will only be temporary , but obamacare is going to have long term consequences that will stifle our economy .		national		partisan		S001154		facebook		attack

for many hardworking families in the 2nd district , balancing the demands of family and the workplace can be difficult . state and local government employees have long been able to choose paid time off as compensation for working overtime hours , allowing these public-sector employees greater flexibility to meet family obligations . however , the federal government prohibits private-sector workers from enjoying this same benefit . to remove this obstacle in federal law , the united states house of representatives will be voting on the working families flexibility act of 2013 . this common-sense legislation allows employers to offer employees a choice between cash wages and comp time for overtime hours worked . it is pro-family , pro-worker legislation that gives workers the flexibility to spend time with family , attend teacher conferences , care for aging parents , stay home with a newborn , or attend to other family needs that may arise . how would you spend your time if congress passed this legislation ?		constituency		partisan		W000812		facebook		policy
