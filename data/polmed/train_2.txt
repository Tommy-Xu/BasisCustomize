yesterday , speaking on the floor of the house of representatives , i shared a story that is close to my heart . a few years ago , my 96 year old mother was diagnosed with an aneurysm close to her heart . due to her advanced age , the doctors believed that surgery was too risky . a few years later that aneurysm got worse , endangering her life . she was re-evaluated , and the doctors concluded that she would not survive without surgery . putting her faith in her doctors , in our healthcare system and in her god , she chose to have the surgery . fortunately she made a full recovery . however , none of this would have been possible without medicare . my mother worked her entire life as a domestic worker , and did not have a private pension or any option other than medicare . as congressional republicans look for an easy way out on these issues , it is people like my mother who are left behind . this is a personal issue to me and the millions of american families with similar stories . republicans have tried for years to destroy medicare by turning it in to a voucher program . they would break the promise we made to our nation ‰ űşs seniors , that if they worked hard they would be taken care of in their old age . medicare is the most efficient health plan in our country , boasting an overhead of only 2 % . the problem isn ‰ űşt medicare ; it ‰ űşs the rising cost of healthcare . one major reason our healthcare costs keep going up is because we have not changed the way patients and doctors see each other . we must be innovative and creative in tackling the cost of healthcare . as the representative of silicon valley , i have led the way in this by promoting innovative technologies such a telemedicine , personal health connected devices , and other tools . i will be reintroducing the healthcare innovation and marketplace technologies act later this year to continue this effort . most importantly , however , i will continue to stand with my friends here in the congress to protect medicare and the medicare guarantee .		national		neutral		H001034		facebook		information

proud to have voted for rep . rob bishop's bill today which adds a review process to the antiquities act . in ' 96 , clinton designated nearly 2 million acres of land in ut as a nat'l monument without any input from the state of ut . that's just unacceptable . if the creation of new nat'l monuments are a good idea , shouldn ‰ űşt others be aware before they go into effect ? shouldn ‰ űşt the monuments have to undergo public scrutiny ? read more in the article below :		national		partisan		S001192		facebook		support

for the first time in four years , we are in a position to pass a budget agreement with strong bipartisan support in both the house and the senate . the bill is not perfect and neither side is happy with everything in the agreement . however , in a year filled with far too much partisan fighting , this compromise is an important step forward . programs that help create jobs in pennsylvania such as community development block grants and nih medical research will likely face fewer cuts under this deal . in addition , overall deficit reduction will be approximately $ 20 billion higher under this agreement than without it . moreover , the bill will allow us avoid another damaging government shutdown . i am hopeful that the measure will pass the senate and that the spirit of bipartisanship will continue into next year . #budget		national		partisan		C001070		facebook		policy

for the past few weeks , i have been undecided , but leaning against , authorizing military strikes in syria . i was willing to remain open until president obama could make his case to the american people , which he did from the east room last night . after listening to the speech , i have not been persuaded to support military action in syria . unfortunately , the speech left unanswered questions about whether or not the administration has a specific plan for a limited military action that will advance broader strategic objectives . it also remains unclear what sorts of planning the administration is undertaking for various contingencies that might arise as a result of the strike . this is consistent with the lack of detail i have received in classified briefings with administration officials . at the very least , clarity and more forthcoming responses on these issues is necessary before i would consider supporting military action . i hold out hope that recent diplomatic developments will bring about a peaceful resolution to the situation . but i also realize that a deal brokered by the russians is unlikely to be , on balance , a very good deal , and will remain difficult to implement . while we wait for the diplomatic track to play itself out , the white house must engage congress in a deeper and more open manner than they have thus far .		national		neutral		Y000064		facebook		policy
