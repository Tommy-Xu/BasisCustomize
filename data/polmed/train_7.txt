today i voted no along with every house democrat , on the gop-ryan budget , which is a disastrous for our economy , our families , and the future of our country . imagine this : if the gop budget actually became law , it would result in 2 million lost jobs in 2014 alone ( according to the economic policy institute ) . instead of common sense investments , such as growing the economy , creating jobs , and strengthening our families , this republican budget is harmful . it lowers taxes on the wealthiest americans , while 66 % of the non-defense budget cuts come from programs helping low or moderate income families . the gop cuts and guts $ 3.7 trillion over the next decade from programs like pell grants for college students , job training for dislocated workers , nutrition programs for poor children , and healthcare for our most vulnerable citizens . congress needs to move forward with a balanced approach to address deficit reduction ‰ űň increased revenues , elimination of special interest tax breaks , smart cuts to failing programs , and investments in growing the economy .		constituency		partisan		M001143		facebook		policy

besides being one of the more beautiful places on god's green earth , tow , texas , also played a significant role in the civil war . in the days before refrigeration , salt was essential for preserving meat and curing leather . the bluffton-tow salt works were one of a handful of sources of salt for the confederacy . during the war , every day the residents of tow would produce 20 to 30 bushels of salt . in 1852 , david and gideon cowan and their mother , ruth , were the first settlers in the area . local indians showed them salt beds near the colorado river , which they developed into saltworks . a year later , john f . morgan and his family were the first settlers to live in the area . they established a hat business , using beaver and other fur trapped locally . william and wilson tow also moved to the area in 1853 and named the nearby area in which they settled tow valley . i am proud of the rich history of the towns and cities in the 11th district . men like the cowans and john morgan are the type of entrepreneurs that built america and give me faith in our future .		constituency		neutral		C001062		facebook		personal

#scotus got it wrong with #hobbylobby . that's why i'm supporting the protect women ‰ űşs health from corporate interference act . the legislation would restore the contraceptive coverage requirement guaranteed by the #acat and protect coverage of other health services from employers who want to impose their beliefs on their employees by denying benefits . allowing employers to force their own religious beliefs on their employees under the guise of religious freedom is inexplicable . the supreme court has put the health of american women at risk while opening the door for private employers who are looking for a reason not to comply with the law . whether a woman uses contraception should be a private decision not subject to a financial veto by her employer . the affordable care act guarantees the majority of women coverage for comprehensive preventive health services , including contraception . imposing additional financial burdens on a woman because her employer claims to hold certain beliefs contrary to the law sets a dangerous precedent . #notmybossbusiness		national		partisan		C000141		facebook		personal
